# debug

## Background
There are two kinds of errors that can occur when writing a program. The first errors you are likely to encounter are syntactical errors. In addition to syntactical errors, there can also be logical errors, which weâ€™ll take a look at soon.

In computer science, syntax is important for a computer to understand what you are telling it to do. Each programming language has its own syntactical rules, which include the combination of both words and punctuation.

This lab starts with distribution code which has several syntactical errors. The idea is for you to try to compile (make) the program, learn to interpret the rather cryptic error messages output by the compiler, and debug the program.
